      <td><p><strong>My Interest and Experience with Information Technology</strong>&nbsp;<br>
        From a young age I always played video games with my father and my two sisters. When social media started to become a thing when I was in high school and everyone was getting on MySpace, I got deep in to modifying profile layouts and creating my own styles. After high school I got a job at a retail store that sold computers, and now I work in a medical software environment providing technical support, therefore I am surrounding by IT everyday. </p>
        <p><strong>Why RMIT?<br>
        </strong>I was looking to get some studies done with Programming, and after doing the Intro to Programming subject through RMIT, I decided to do Intro to IT. RMIT offered the largest range of Programming subjects, and has a good reputation for Information Technology related studies. </p>
        <p><strong>What do I want to learn?</strong><br>
          Within this course I expect to learn a lot of the general aspects of the Information Technology world and how I can further my career with a greater understanding of IT.&nbsp; </p></td>

      <td><p><strong>My Ideal Job</strong>&nbsp;<br>
        The ideal job that I have chosen is a Quality Assurance Analyst on the game League of Legends for the company Riot Games. https://www.riotgames.com/en/work-with-us/job/1647573</p>
        <p><img src="QA JOB.png" width="419" height="960" alt=""/></p>
        <p><strong>Description of the job</strong> <br>
          The job would involve creating test cases and going through the test cases to ensure that the quality of the game League of Legends is top tier, and gives the players across the world the best experience. I have been playing League of Legends for a number of years, and with my work experience, I am very intrigued in problem solving and ensuring everything works as expected. As such, to tie my love of gaming, and my love of making sure everything works as expected, it would make sense for me to pursue a career within Quality Analysis in the gaming industry.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills required for the job <br>
        </strong>For this role, it would be needed to have high depth knowledge of the game League of Legends along with experience with both manual and automated QA. It would be required to be adept at communication, which would allow you to communicate with the development team at a high level, and great problem solving skills to go through and troubleshoot issues. </p>
        <p><strong>How to achieve the skills </strong><br>
          With my current work experience, I have been involved in manual testing of software and by taking this subject, and the Programming 1 subject, I am wanting to be able to develop programming skills to be then able to look further in automation testing. </p></td>

      <td><strong>What do the results mean</strong> <br>
        <p>The Myers-Briggs test showed that I am an INTP-T, the learning style test showed that I am mostly a tactile learner and the Work Style test showed that I am open to learn. These do not come as a surprise to me as I have felt the same way throughout my entire life. I feel like the tests just show that whilst I am very introverted and closed off, I am a thinker and a learner and am always open to improving. </p>

        <p><strong>How will I work within a team<br>
        </strong>As the tests can show I can be introverted and not a leader, it can be hard to join a team. Within a team I do definitely have to push myself out of my comfort zone to participate and offer my opinions, and sometimes will not give opinions as I do not want to feel like I am interrupting conversation. </p>
        <p><strong>How to work in a team better </strong><br>
          When joining a team, I feel it is necessary to ensure that there is someone willing to be a leader, however they are also open to hear everyone’s ideas. As a hands on learner, I suspect it will be hard to collaborate within a team environment online as it is very auditory and visual compared to if you were to meet your team in person. As such, I feel like I will have to push myself harder to ensure that I interact with everyone and feel comfortable with sharing my experiences and ideas. </p></td>

      <td><strong>Overview</strong> <br>
        <p>I currently work at a Medical Software company, that has two Practice Management Products, along with other Value Added Services. With technology moving forward, it is quite trivial that at our company we do not have a eCommerce store to allow our customers to pay invoices online, and purchase our Value Added Services. Right now, we have people employed within our Accounts Department that are not able to do their standard jobs as they spend most of their time on the phone just taking credit card payments. The idea would be to create an eCommerce store allowing our customers to pay their invoices, and purchase our Value Added Services all online in their own time. </p>
        <p><strong>Motivation </strong><br>
          My company, Genie Solutions (www.geniesolutionssoftware.com.au) has the purpose of ‘Helping Medical Professionals Deliver Better Health Outcomes’. The motivation of this online shop is to ensure that the medical professionals that use our product are able to access features within their own time, not relying on our head office being open and able to take their call. Every day our team take simple calls regarding accounts and Value Added Services which could be solved by a simple online shop, which if implemented would free up our time, to help our customers more, and free up our customers time, to allow them to help their patients more. </p>
        <p><strong>Description </strong><br>
          The problem that I see within the business is that there is too much time spent on small things, such as manually processing credit card information, printing invoices and manually sending them out, and having to allocate information manually. The product would give our customers a place to come to pay their invoice each month/quarter/year without calling our Accounts team, which would free up time for both our customers and our Accounts team. It would allow our customers to access our website at any point, input their customer number and see their invoice/pay their invoice. To break down this, at present we would input the information manually into the software MYOB, which we would then have to either print a manual copy of the invoice or print it to PDF. From then we would have to either send the invoice via mail or send it via email to the customer for them to then pay. Once this is done, the customer then has to find a time where they are able to call us, and process this payment over the phone. We are aware that our customers run busy practices, and as such, do not have the time to call our office to then manually pay the invoice. Having an online shop would allow us to automate the process of the invoice being created and sent to the customer, and then the customer would have the decision to pay within their own time. Having an online shop would also allow the customer to set up a direct debit, therefore eliminating the need for contact between the two parties, and having everything be automated. This would also allow our customers to access our shop to look at our Value Added Services, and purchase them. For an example, we have SMS Reminders available to send out to our customer’s database. To use these they need to purchase these credits. From the online shop, they would be able to check their credits, purchase their credits and enable auto top up. </p>
        <p><strong>Tools and Technologies </strong><br>
          Looking at a tool like Shopify (https://www.shopify.com.au/) it would be possible to implement this. We would then just need to have this interact with the products we use, such as Salesforce, MYOB, and our own inhouse products that control our Value Added Services and licensing of our products. This would be done using API’s to connect to our inhouse products, and the functionality that is already available within Shopify to connect to MYOB and Salesforce. As Shopify is all hosted within the cloud, there would not be a need for hardware. </p>
        <p><strong>Skills Required </strong><br>
          The skills needed would be to become comfortable with using the Shopify software and then working with our inhouse developers, to connect with our API’s to connect to our products. From browsing the website of Shopify and their information knowledgebase it appears quite simple to integrate with Salesforce and MYOB, therefore it would appear we would just need to follow the information that they provide. </p>
        <p><strong>Outcome </strong><br>
          Once this project is successful, it will give both our customers and ourselves more time to help deliver better outcomes to both our customer bases. This project will give time back to both parties, and will allow a more seamless experience which will at the end of the day make both parties happier. It will also allow future endeavors from the company to be more accessible in future and will give our customers a better experience. </p></td>
